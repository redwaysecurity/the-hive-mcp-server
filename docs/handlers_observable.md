## Description

TheHive Observable Handler Functions

This module provides handler functions for managing observables (Indicators of
Compromise - IoCs) in TheHive platform. Observables are key pieces of evidence
that can be analyzed, enriched with threat intelligence, and used for detection.

Observable types include:
- IP addresses and domains
- File hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256)
- Email addresses and URLs
- File names and registry keys
- Custom observable types

Planned Functions:
create_observable: Add a new observable to a case or alert
search_observables: Find observables based on criteria
update_observable: Modify observable properties or tags
delete_observable: Remove an observable
bulk_create_observables: Add multiple observables efficiently

Note:
This module is currently under development. Handler functions will be
implemented to support comprehensive observable management operations.
