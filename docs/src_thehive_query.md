TheHive Query Builder and Utilities

This module provides utilities for building and executing queries against TheHive
platform. It includes helper functions for constructing complex search queries,
filters, and aggregations across different TheHive entities.

Query capabilities include:
- Dynamic query construction
- Filter composition and validation
- Search parameter optimization
- Query result processing

Planned Functions:
    build_alert_query: Construct queries for alert searches
    build_case_query: Construct queries for case searches
    build_observable_query: Construct queries for observable searches
    validate_query: Validate query syntax and parameters
    execute_query: Execute query and process results

Note:
    This module is currently under development. Query builder functions will be
    implemented to support advanced search capabilities across TheHive entities.
