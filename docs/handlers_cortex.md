## Description

TheHive Cortex Integration Handler Functions

This module provides handler functions for integrating with Cortex analyzers
and responders. Cortex is TheHive's analysis engine that can automatically
analyze observables and execute response actions.

Cortex integration enables:
- Automated observable analysis (malware detection, reputation checks, etc.)
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- Automated response actions
- Custom analyzer and responder execution

Planned Functions:
run_analyzer: Execute a Cortex analyzer on an observable
get_analysis_results: Retrieve results from completed analyses
run_responder: Execute a Cortex responder action
list_analyzers: Get available analyzers for an observable type
list_responders: Get available responders for an observable type

Note:
This module is currently under development. Handler functions will be
implemented to support comprehensive Cortex integration operations.
Requires proper Cortex server configuration and analyzer/responder setup.
